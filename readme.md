Heroku - 

## Prerequisites

1. Python installed in your system

## Steps to run

1. Clone this repository in your local

2. Create a virtual environment in the parent directory to setup the runtime environment

   `python -m venv myvenv`

   On Mac this would be

   `python3 -m virtualenv myvenv`

   Make sure that you don't have **myvenv** in the same directory as the project and git is not tracking it. An ideal folder tree would look like -

   ```
   movietwizt
   |-- mtzt
      |-- mtapp
      |-- mtzt
      |-- db.sqlite3
   |-- myvenv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment by going to `myvenv/Scripts/` and running the script `activate`

4. Install Django

   `pip install django==2.0.5`
   'pip install django -paypal'
   'pip install pillow'
   'pip install django-crispy-forms'

5. Use the below details to access the superuser page

   username - **test**

   password - **movietester**
